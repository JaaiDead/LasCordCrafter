The rights for these emojis/icons/images/other files may differ, please review that separately for each.

All of the emojis/icons/images/other files in this folder were obtained from emoji.gg -> https://emoji.gg
They probably have some kind of policy of their own, so research that if you want info on that.
The user who uploaded them, and is thus our direct source, was never_see -> https://emoji.gg/user/never_see.

DO YOU OWN ANY OF THESE FILES/THE RIGHTS TO THEM AND WANT THEM REMOVED FROM THE REPO?
FEEL FREE TO CONTACT US, AND PLEASE DO SO WE CAN DISCUSS STUFF!
mailto:info.tywrap.studio@gmail.com

Note that the emojis wont be removed from the bot itself if not explicitly requested with a proper reasoning.
Reason being that they were obtained through emoji.gg -> https://emoji.gg, and this is their technical intended use, please hold them accountable and not us.
This can all be properly discussed though, so do not worry.
