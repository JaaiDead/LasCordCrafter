The rights for these emojis/icons/images/other files may differ, please review that separately for each.

DO YOU OWN ANY OF THESE FILES/THE RIGHTS TO THEM AND WANT THEM REMOVED FROM THE REPO AND/OR THE BOT?
FEEL FREE TO CONTACT US, AND PLEASE DO SO WE CAN DISCUSS STUFF!
mailto:info.tywrap.studio@gmail.com

Note that some emojis wont be removed from the bot if not explicitly requested with a proper reasoning.
Reason being that some of them we have explicit permission for, or fall under fair use.
This can all be properly discussed though, so do not worry.
